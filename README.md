# passman-rs

A local password manager written in Rust. Supports a CLI application and a WIP Tauri frontend.

This is a rewritten version an older project of mine. At the time of writing *that version*, my Rust skills were quite awful. The code was terrible and impossible to read. This codebase is an attempt to rewrite that project with better, cleaner code.
This codebase will also (hopefully) support an actual GUI frontend, and perhaps a client-server implementation.
